# Getting started with WebSharper

The following examples demonstrate key concepts that help you get up to speed with WebSharper. You can use these as a roadmap to learn the fundamentals of WebSharper, before going into the rest of the documentation.

1. [Hello world](/examples/hello.md) - a simple web application that responds "Hello World". Learn how to return different content, such as files, JSON, or error codes from your sitelet endpoints.

2. [Single-page applications](/examples/spa.md) - learn how to reduce/eliminate HTML from your F# code using strongly-typed, isomorphic templating.
