# Using WebSharper with ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC

WebSharper is self-sufficient and can run as the single component of a web application, but it can also be integrated into an existing ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC application. This integration is twofold:

* Client-side WebSharper controls can be used within an ASPX or Razor page. This allows you to use C#/F#-compiled-to-JavaScript directly within an existing page, and take advantage of client-side generated markup with UI.Next and easy remote calls.

* Full WebSharper [sitelets](sitelets) can run alongside an ASP.NET application, sharing the same URL space, as well as the same server state, sessions, etc.

In any case, you need to add the following references to your ASP.NET web project:

* Your WebSharper project;

* [The WebSharper NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/WebSharper/);

* FSharp.Core. You can find it under Assemblies / Extensions in Visual Studio's "Add Reference" dialog, or [get it from NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core/) if you prefer.

    If you use F# 3.1 or more recent (most likely), then you also need to add a binding redirect to your `Web.config`:

    ```xml
    <configuration>
      <runtime>
        <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
          <dependentAssembly>
            <assemblyIdentity name="FSharp.Core" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
            <!-- For F# 3.1:
            <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.3.1.0" newVersion="4.3.1.0" />
            -->
            <!-- For F# 4.0: -->
            <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.4.0.0" newVersion="4.4.0.0" />
          </dependentAssembly>
          ...
    ```

* [The WebSharper.AspNetMvc package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/WebSharper.AspNetMvc), if you are using ASP.NET MVC and/or the Razor view engine.

## Integrating client-side controls in ASP.NET pages

Ordinary ASP.NET applications are heavily server-based: content is rendered on the server
and sent to the client, and any client interaction typically involves a server roundtrip.
This can be eased somewhat using Ajax techniques on the client, where content or data is
retrieved from the server asynchronously. Such content then is integrated into the
presentation layer (on the client) once it becomes available after the call.

WebSharper makes it even easier to communicate with the server by enabling clients to make
RPC calls seamlessly, as easily as making a client-side call.
Here is a snippet to illustrate this in both languages:

* Define a remote method and a client-side `Web.Control` in C#

```csharp
public static class Server
{
    [Remote]
    public static Task<int[]> GetData()
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new[] { 1, 2, 3});
    }
}

[Serializable]
public class SimpleClientServerControl : WebSharper.Web.Control
{
    [JavaScript]
    public override IControlBody Body
    {
        get
        {
            var model = new ListModel<int, int>(x => x);
            // call the server-side asynchronously, insert response items to ListModel
            Task.Run(async () =>
            {
                foreach (var n in await Server.GetData())
                    model.Add(n);
            });
            return ul(model.View.DocSeqCached((int x) => li("Value= ", x)));
        }
    }
}
```

* Define a remote method and a client-side `Web.Control` in F#

``` fsharp
namespace WebSharperProject
    
open WebSharper

module Server =
    [<Rpc>]
    let GetData () = async { return [1; 2; 3] }

module Client =
    open WebSharper.Html.Client

    [<JavaScript>]
    let Main () =
        let ul = UL
        // call the server-side asynchronously, insert response items to DOM
        async {
            let! data = Server.GetData ()
            for i in data do
                ul.Append(LI [Text ("Value= " + i)])
        } |> Async.Start
        ul
    
type SimpleClientServerControl() =
    inherit Web.Control()
    
    [<JavaScript>]
    override this.Body = Client.Main () :> _
```

Here is how to integrate the above client-side control in your ASPX or Razor page.

### Integrating client-side controls in ASPX pages

The class `Web.Control` used in the above snippet inherits from `System.Web.UI.Control`, which means
that it can be included directly in an ASPX page. Here are the necessary steps:

* Add declarations for your content to `Web.config`:

    ``` xml
    <configuration>
      <system.web>
        <pages>
          <controls>
            <add tagPrefix="WebSharper" namespace="WebSharper.Web" assembly="WebSharper.Web"/>
            <add tagPrefix="ws" namespace="WebSharperProject" assembly="WebSharperProject"/>
          </controls>
          ...
    ```

    * The first entry makes the WebSharper ScriptManager available, and it should remain in `Web.Config` for all WebSharper ASPX-based applications.

    * The second entry declares that there is a `WebSharperProject` assembly with a namespace with the same name. This is what the default WebSharper ASP.NET and other ASP.NET-based Visual Studio project templates write by default. If you change the name of your WebSharper assemblies, or the namespaces they contain, you should update this entry or add further entries to cover those namespaces.

* In the `<head>` of your ASPX page (or `Site.Master` if you use one), add the WebSharper ScriptManager:

    ``` xml
    <head runat="server">
      <WebSharper:ScriptManager runat="server" />
      ...
    ```
    
    This will include all the CSS and scripts needed by the controls on your page. Make sure that the `<head>` tag is marked `runat="server"`.

* Insert the control itself in your ASPX page:

    ``` xml
    <ws:SimpleClientServerControl runat="server" />
    ```
    
    Even though it may seem that your WebSharper control runs on the server (as would be indicated by the `runat="server"` attribute in your ASPX markup), this is not the case. Instead, this server control embeds a placeholder in your host page, and the WebSharper ScriptManager control takes care of "bringing it to life" by populating it when your page loads on the client, also referencing any dependencies it may have to ensure correct behavior.

### Integrating client-side controls in Razor pages

Razor integration is provided by WebSharper.AspNetMvc. Here are the necessary steps:

* In your main razor layout, inside the head tag, add the following:

    ``` csharp
    @WebSharper.AspNetMvc.ScriptManager.Head()
    ```

    This will include all the CSS and scripts needed by the controls on your page.

* To insert a control in a view, first create it at the top of the view:

    ``` csharp
    @{
        var myControl = WebSharper.AspNetMvc.ScriptManager.Register(new MyControl());
    }
    ```

    and then you can insert it in the view, eg:

    ``` xml
    <div>
        <h1>My control:</h1>
        @myControl
    </div>
    ```

    It is important to create the control before the view starts rendering, or else `ScriptManager.Head()` will already have been rendered without this control's dependencies.

### Using remoting

To enable WebSharper remoting, `Web.Config` must contain the declaration for the WebSharper HTTP module. This module is responsible for all RPC communication and comes already configured in the WebSharper Visual Studio project templates for ASP.NET. You should see something like this:

* For IIS 7.x+:

    ``` xml
    <configuration>
      <system.webServer>
        <modules>
          <add name="WebSharper.RemotingModule"
               type="WebSharper.Web.RpcModule, WebSharper.Web"/>
        </modules>
        ...
    ```

* For IIS 6.x:

    ``` xml
    <configuration>
      <system.web>
        <httpModules>
          <add name="WebSharper.RemotingModule"
               type="WebSharper.Web.RpcModule, WebSharper.Web"/>
        </httpModules>
        ...
    ```

In addition, if you are using ASP.NET MVC, you need to add WebSharper to your filters configuration, located in `App_Start/FilterConfig.cs` in a default ASP.NET MVC application:

``` csharp
public static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters)
{
    filters.Add(new WebSharper.AspNetMvc.Filter());
}
```


## Running Sitelets alongside ASP.NET

If you want to take full advantage of WebSharper's server-side facilities, including type-safe
URLs and composable websites, as part of an ASP.NET application, it is very easy to do so.

### In an existing ASP.NET application

In order to integrate a WebSharper Sitelet into an existing ASP.NET application, you need to
reference your Sitelet project from the ASP.NET website project, and add the following code
to your `Web.config` file:

* For IIS 7.x, 8.x:

    ``` xml
    <configuration>
      <system.webServer>
        <modules>
          <add name="WebSharper.RemotingModule"
               type="WebSharper.Web.RpcModule, WebSharper.Web"/>
          <add name="WebSharper.Sitelets"
               type="WebSharper.Sitelets.HttpModule, WebSharper.Sitelets"/>
        </modules>
        ...
    ```

* For IIS 6.x:

    ``` xml
    <configuration>
      <system.web>
        <httpModules>
          <add name="WebSharper.RemotingModule"
               type="WebSharper.Web.RpcModule, WebSharper.Web"/>
          <add name="WebSharper.Sitelets"
               type="WebSharper.Sitelets.HttpModule, WebSharper.Sitelets"/>
        </httpModules>
        ...
    ```

In addition, just like with remoting, if you are using ASP.NET MVC, you need to add WebSharper to your filters configuration, located in `App_Start/FilterConfig.cs` in a default ASP.NET MVC application:

``` csharp
public static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters)
{
    filters.Add(new WebSharper.AspNetMvc.Filter());
}
```

Note that you can specify which of ASP.NET MVC or WebSharper Sitelets' routing takes precedence in case their URL space overlaps. By default, WebSharper takes precedence.

``` csharp
    filters.Add(new WebSharper.AspNetMvc.Filter { SiteletsOverrideMvc = false });
```

### In a new ASP.NET project

We generally advise against using WebSharper alongside ASP.NET for a new application,
and recommend instead to simply run a WebSharper Sitelets application to contain the
whole application. Nevertheless, the [Visual Studio extension](/downloads) includes a
template that facilitates creating an ASP.NET/Sitelets hybrid application. The
"Sitelets Host Website" template is an ASP.NET Web application template that includes
the facilities describe above to run alongside Sitelets. All you have to do is to
include a reference to your Sitelets project in this web project, and you're good to go!
